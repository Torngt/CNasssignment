## 1: 
- IP address: 192.168.18.21
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
- Network Address: 192.168.18.0
- Broadcast Address: 192.169.18.255
- Default Gateway: 192.168.18.1

## 2:

Total number of end devices that my network can support can be calculated by using subnet mask. 
Network bits = 24
host bits    = 8 
hence supported end devices = 2^8-2=254
We subtracted 2 because one of the address is network address and where first 8 bits from right hand side will all be 0 and of the address is broadcasting address where first 8 bits will be all 1 .
