  A. HTTP Request Dissection
     An HTTP request consists of several components: the request line, headers, and optionally a body. Here’s how to dissect it:
     Request Line :- 
        - Method : Indicates the HTTP method used (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        - URL : The path of the resource being requested.
        - Version: The HTTP version being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).                      
        - Example: GET /connecttest.txt HTTP/1.1\r\n
              •	Method: GET
              •	URL: www.msftconnecttest/connecttest.txt
              •	Version: HTTP/1.1   


   B. HTTP Response Dissection 
      An HTTP response consists of a status line, headers, and optionally a body. Here’s how to dissect it:
      Status Line :-
        - Version : The HTTP version used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
        - Status Code : A three-digit code indicating the result of the request (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
    	- Reason Phrase : A brief description of the status code (e.g., OK, Not Found, Internal Server Error).
        - Example : HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
              •	Version: HTTP/1.1
              •	Status Code: 200
              •	Reason Phrase: OK
